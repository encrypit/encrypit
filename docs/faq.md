## How does Encrypit work?

When you drag-and-drop a file in your browser, the file gets encrypted with a randomly generated password. During upload, the encrypted file is stored on our server and a file link is created. When the link is opened, the encrypted file is downloaded and decrypted in the browser. Throughout the entire process, Encrypit does not know what the password is, which ensures that the file remain secure.

## Is Encrypit really private?

We're confident that Encrypit is both private and secure and we want to ensure it remains that way. For more details, see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## How can I send my file? Is there a way to send the link via Encrypit?

Encrypit provides a link to your file. You must copy and paste that link into an email or message and send it to the person you want to download the file.

## Can I send my encrypted file to multiple recipients?

Encrypit does not support sending encrypted files to multiple recipients.

## What if I sent a file by mistake?

There's a button to delete your file after uploading it. Or you can paste the link in your browser's address bar and delete the file by downloading it. When the person you sent the link attempts to download the file, he or she will get a message saying that the file is not found.

## Can I know when the file is downloaded?

Encrypit does not store when a file is downloaded. You can verify that a file is deleted by trying to download it.

## Can I redownload a file via the browser history, the back button, or the closed tabs feature?

The file is deleted after download, so there's no way to redownload it again unless the download page was not closed.

## How long are files stored on your servers?

Files that have not been downloaded are automatically deleted after 7 days. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## How do you make money?

Encrypit is a free service [supported](/support) by users like you. ðŸ˜Š
