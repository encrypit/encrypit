## How does Encrypit work?

Encrypit uses [end-to-end encryption](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) so only the sender and the recipient can read/modify the file.

The flow is as follows:

1. The sender drags and drops the file to Encrypit's website.
2. The browser encrypts the file with a random password.
3. The sender uploads the encrypted file (but not the password) to Encrypit's server and a file id is created.
4. The browser generates a download link from the file id and password.
5. The sender shares the download link with the receiver.
6. The receiver opens the link, which destroys the file on Encrypit's server.
7. The browser decrypts the file so the receiver can download it.

Throughout the entire process, Encrypit does not know what the password is, which ensures the file remains secure.

## Is Encrypit really private?

Privacy is really important to us, and we're confident that Encrypit is private and secure. For more details, check out our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## How can I send my file? Is there a way to send the link via Encrypit?

Encrypit provides a link to your file. You must copy and paste that link into an email or message and send it to the person you want to download the file.

## Can I send my encrypted file to multiple recipients?

Encrypit does not support sending encrypted files to multiple recipients.

## What if I sent a file by mistake?

There's a button to delete your file after uploading it. Or you can paste the link in your browser's address bar and delete the file by downloading it. When the person you sent the link attempts to download the file, he or she will get a message saying that the file is not found.

## Can I know when the file is downloaded?

Encrypit does not store when a file is downloaded. You can verify that a file is deleted by trying to download it.

## Can I redownload a file via the browser history, the back button, or the closed tabs feature?

The file is deleted after download, so there's no way to redownload it again unless the download page was not closed.

## How long are files stored on your servers?

Files that have not been downloaded are automatically deleted after 7 days. See our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## How do you make money?

Encrypit is a free service [supported](/support) by users like you. ðŸ˜Š
