# Privacy Policy

Last modified: **1 July 2023**

At Encrypit, privacy is taken very seriously, since the main purpose of the site is to preserve it. This policy outlines the measures taken by Encrypit to protect the privacy of its users.

## 1. Service description

Encrypit is a free web based service that allows users to create encrypted files that they can share over the internet as unique one-time-use HTTPS URLs (hereafter referred to as links) which by default expire after its first access via any browser.

As Encrypit does not provide any means for transmitting the link, the act of sending the link is the full responsibility of Encrypit users.

Depending on the communication channel of your choice (e.g., email, SMS, phone, instant messaging, social media, etc.), there may be a certain risk that third parties intercept your communication, get knowledge of the communicated link, and thus may be able to read your files.

## 2. How the files and its contents are processed

The link is generated in the user's browser and at no time is sent as such to Encrypit. The link is thus in the sender's (and later possibly in the recipient's) hands only. Therefore, there is no way to recover a file if an Encrypit user loses the link.

Since only the link binds the decryption key to the file's content and since Encrypit does not have the link, at no time is any file held in any readable format state at Encrypit. This assures that nobody (including Encrypit's administrators) can read a file.

When using Encrypit's default funtionality, when a file is retrieved, its data is completely removed from Encrypit; there is absolutely no way to recover it again.

After a file is deleted from Encrypit, there is absolutely no way to recover it again.

When a file is not retrieved after 7 days, Encrypit removes it permanently, just as if it were read. The Encrypit sysadmin team will do as much as possible to protect the site against unauthorized access, modification, or destruction of the data. But even if someone or something could manage to gain access to the data store, they would be unable to read the files since their contents are encrypted and can't be decrypted without the links which Encrypit never has a hold of.

## 3. Processing of IP addresses

Encrypit is not logging the IP addresses; they are processed to enable communication with Encrypit's servers but they are not part of the log-files.

## 4. Pseudonymous data

The uploader of the file can upload a file with personal data. Even though this data is encrypted, the data can be decrypted again and thus constitutes pseudonymous (personal) data. In any case, one cannot deduce the file's creator from Encrypit's data store, as Encrypit does not store IP addresses.

The decryption of the file's data is in the users' hands (sender and recipient). Encrypit is not able to decrypt the file and access the data (personal or otherwise) introduced by the creator since Encrypit is never in possession of the decryption key which is contained only in the link.

## 5. Disclaimer

When a person clicks the Encrypit's link, Encrypit declines any responsibility related to the file's content.

## 6. Disclosure of Data to Third Party

Encrypit does not share nor sell any information to others, nor use it in any way not mentioned in this Privacy Policy.

## 7. Use of cookies

Encrypit does not use cookies (small text files that are stored on your computer by your browser when you visit a website).

## 8. Children

Encrypit does not target and is not intended to attract children under the age of 21. Minors must obtain express consent from their parents or legal guardians prior to accessing or using Encrypit.

## 9. Validity of this Privacy Policy

Encrypit may make changes to this policy from time to time and will notify you of such changes by posting an updated date on this page. Your continued use of Encrypit constitutes your acceptance of any changes to the Privacy Policy concerning, but not limited to, both previously and prospectively collected information.
